# Installation

Backup existing config:
```sh
mv ~/.emacs.d ~/.emacs.d_backup
```
Clone this repo to `~/.emacs.d`:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/rsm-lisper/emacs-config/ ~/.emacs.d/
```
Start Emacs. It'll display a lot of errors because of missing packages. To install them - run Emacs function `M-x` `package-install-selected-packages`.

**Done! :)**
